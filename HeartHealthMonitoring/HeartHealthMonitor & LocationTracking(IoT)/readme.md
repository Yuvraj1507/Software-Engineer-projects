# Heart Health Monitoring Dashboard

This project is a **Real-Time Health Monitoring Dashboard** built using **Flask**, **SQLite**, and **Plotly**. The application simulates heart rate, body temperature, and location data, stores it in an SQLite database, and visualizes it in real-time on a web dashboard.


## Project Overview

This health monitoring system simulates the collection of heart rate, body temperature, and geographical location. This data is stored in an **SQLite** database (`health_data.db`), and **Flask** is used as the backend framework to fetch this data and serve it on a web dashboard. 

The frontend is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Plotly** for graphing the heart rate and body temperature data in real-time.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need the following installed on your local machine:

- **Python 3.x**
- **Flask**: Python web framework
- **Plotly.js**: JavaScript library for interactive visualizations (included via CDN)

---

## Features:
- **Real-time Health Data**: Monitors heart rate (BPM), body temperature (Â°C), and geographical location (latitude and longitude).
- **Plotly Graphs**: Interactive graphs for heart rate and body temperature.
- **SQLite Database**: Stores health data for persistence even if the server restarts.
- **Flask Backend**: Simple API for delivering health data to the frontend.
- **Alerts**: Displays alerts for abnormal health metrics (e.g., low heart rate, high fever).
- **Backend API**: Flask server provides health data through an API endpoint (`/health_data`).
- **Multi-Threading**: Health data is updated in the background using threads.
- **pySerial**: Python to communicate with Arduino via Serial Communication or other interfaces.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Python web framework for creating the backend server.
- **JavaScript (AJAX)**: Used to fetch and display real-time health data every few seconds.
- **HTML/CSS**: For designing the dashboard interface.
- **Threading (Python)**: Used to periodically update the health data in the background.

# Testing the Health Data

You can also test the data being inserted and fetched from the SQLite database using this Python script:
python

import sqlite3

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('health_data.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Fetch the latest health data
cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM health_data ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 5')
data = cursor.fetchall()

# Print the data
for row in data:
    print(row)

conn.close()

This script will print the latest 5 entries from the table. You should see heart rate, body temperature, latitude, longitude, and timestamp for each entry.health_data
